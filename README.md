# TOOL IS STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION IT MAY/DOES NOT WORK
(especilly in non-debian based distros)

# SKToolkit
Swiss Knife Toolkit, or SKToolkit for short, Is an All-in-one toolkit filled with most of the penetration testing tools you'd need, made simple !

# Installation
To install SKToolkit, simply go to your terminal and type:
``` git clone https://github.com/threee3k/SKToolkit.git ```
cd into SKT/maintool and then execute skt.sh
```./skt.sh ``` or ``` bash skt.sh ```
Note: You need to install some other stuff in order to properly run the tool with no errors, read requirments.txt.
And that's it !

# Usage
Just like the name suggests, Swiss Knife Toolkit has multiple penetration testing (or hacking if you prefer) tools and scripts that are combined into categories according to their type.
To make it easier and less time-consuming, I've created a Text User Interface in which you can:
-Select what type of attack you want (wifi,sites ect..)

-Choose the attack you want (deauth, evil twin ect...)

-Some inputs and Taadaa! you just launched an attack

# Additional Notes
DO NOT USE THIS TOOL FOR UNETHICAL REASONS
DO NOT HACK MACHINES UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN PERMISSION TO
I DO NOT HOLD ANY RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY ILLEGAL ACTIONS THAT INVOLVE THIS TOOL
(saying this like it's some mega corporation hacking script lmao)
Also this script was inspired by Social-Engineering-Toolkit, check them out!
